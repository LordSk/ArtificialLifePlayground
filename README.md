# Artificial life playground

This is a reproduction of the demo presented by Dave Ackley in his presentation:

[![NMCS4ALL: Artificial Life (full version)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YJRRu4dJnTI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJRRu4dJnTI "NMCS4ALL: Artificial Life (full version)")

## Goals
* ✅ Discover the zig programming language
* ✅ Implement a more performant version of Dave Ackley's demo

## TODO
* ✅ Efficient sprite renderer (1M+ at 144+Hz)
* ✅ Dear ImGui integration
* ✅ Camera controls
* ✅ "Lifeform" logic
* ✅ Export to image
* Mutating herbivore logic

## Results

After implementing mutating plants I discovered I accidently made some kind of art generator, here are some results:
